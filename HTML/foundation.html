			<li> There are many different ways to set up your garden, and it is mostly dependent of the space 
					you have and the space you want to use.</li><br> 
					<li> If you have plenty of room to spare, it's very easy to set up your garden for the perfect growing conditions. 
					First of all, you should make sure the area is level, so you prevent puddles of water. Dig down about 40 cm. </li> <br> 
				<li> Next, you should put down a layer of pine cortex (about 10cm), and a layer of cloth on top of that. 
				This is done so your soil doesn't get contaminated with dirt or something else that can reduce the quality of your product</li> <br>
					<li>Now it's time to put your soil on top of the cloth. Remember that different plants go into the soil at
							different depths. You can dig deeper if you want plants that require it.</li> <br>
						<li> You should fertilize your soil with either store-bought fertilizer or self-made from compost.
						You should buy soil from your local store or online. On our "Resources" page, you can find out where. </li> <br>
								<li> If you don't have much space, you should consider using plant boxes instead. The process here is 
										pretty much the same, but you don't need to think about laying down a layer of pine cortex 
										you should however have a layer of cloth in the bottom to make it easier to clean up 
										when you get rid of the plant box</li>
