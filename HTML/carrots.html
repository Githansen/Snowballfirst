	  <li>If you have read our other guides, you might have noticed that growing your own vegetables is simple.
	  Carrots are no exception. </li> <br>
	  <li> When growing carrots, you will start by planting seeds in pots inside. Keep them in a warm and well lit place.
	  After a few weeks, you will see leaves starting to rise from the soil. At this time, they are ready to be replanted outside.
		Make sure you keep the soil moist during the whole process. Water regularly from a spray bottle.</li> <br>
	  <li>When replanting outside, make sure the plants are at least 15cm apart from each other. </li> <br>
	  <li> The whole process should take 70-80 days. Knowing when the carrots are ready to harvest is difficult in the beginning.
		You should remove some dirt from the top of the plant and check how thick the carrots are. If they have the same thickness
		as your thumb, they are probably ready to be harvested. 
		</li> <br> 
		
		<li> Carrots require very little attention, but make sure the soil they are planted in is nutritious, 
			preferrably with fertilizer added. You can read more about this in our guide "The Foundation"</li> <br>
