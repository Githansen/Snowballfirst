	  <h2> Preparation </h2>
	  <li>It's crucial to take good care of your tomatoes in the beginning since 
	  they need good conditions to grow properly.</li> <br>
	  <li>You will need approximately 7x7 cm per plant. 
	  The pots should be filled 2/3 to the top with <a href = "https://www.plantasjen.no/jord-gronnsaker-og-krydder-40-l-510360.html">
	  vegetable soil. </a>  Fill the rest of the pots with<a href = "https://tinyurl.com/y5rvaqv6"> sowing soil.</a> </li>
	  <br> 
	  <li>Now it's time to plant the seeds, and water the soil carefully. In the beginning it's enough to spray them with a bottle,
	  be careful so the plants don't drown. </li><br>
	  
	  <li>Place the pots in a warm, lit up place. Alternatively, you can cover them with a plastic bag with holes,
	  so you keep the pots moist and warm. When the seeds have grown, they can be placed somewhere colder,
	  but it's still important to give the plants enough light. The plants should stay in this state for about 4 weeks  </li>
	  
	  <h2>Replanting </h2>
	  <li> When you see the first leaves, the plant is ready to be moved outside and replanted.
		When replanting, choose pots that are about 12cm in diameter,
		preferably with a decent height. Check specifications of the seeds you buy. If you don't have access to pots you can replant
		in milk cartons. But beware, bigger is better, so you should invest in some real pots.
		Optimally, you wait another 3-4 weeks before you move them outside, so you have better control of them.
		Moving them outside is only required for the final stage of the process. Keep them inside if you live in a colder climate.
		Water the plants regularly, and place them somewhere warm and dry with 
		good lighting. </li> 
 <br>
		<li> After about 2 weeks in this state, it's time to take the plants outside. For this, you 
				should find a warm spot. On our resources page, you can read in detail how you should 
					set up your outside growspot.  </li> <br>
			<li>
		The plant is ready to be harvested when you can spot the first light blush of color. 
			At this point it will mature even after it's been picked. Depending on the plant, this will take 4-8 weeks 
				at this point of the process.</li>
